# Admin Dashboard Testing Instructions

## Issue Fixed
The admin dashboard was not loading appointments when users logged in. This has been fixed by:

1. **Added proper admin role verification** in `admin-dashboard.html`
2. **Enhanced error handling** in the appointments API calls
3. **Added debugging middleware** to track API requests
4. **Created admin user** in the database

## How to Test

### 1. Login as Admin
- Go to `http://localhost:5000/login.html`
- Use these credentials:
  - Email: `admin@shinesmile.com`
  - Password: `admin123`
- You should be automatically redirected to `admin-dashboard.html`

### 2. Check Admin Dashboard
- The dashboard should load appointments automatically
- If no appointments are found, it will show "No appointments found"
- You can refresh appointments using the "Refresh Appointments" button

### 3. Test API Directly
- Use the test page: `http://localhost:5000/test-admin.html`
- This page will automatically test authentication and appointments loading

### 4. Check Console for Debug Info
- Open browser developer tools (F12)
- Check the console for debug messages
- Look for any error messages

## Admin User Details
- **Email**: admin@shinesmile.com
- **Password**: admin123
- **Role**: admin

## Troubleshooting
If appointments still don't load:

1. **Check browser console** for JavaScript errors
2. **Check server logs** for API request logs
3. **Verify token** is stored in localStorage
4. **Test API directly** using the test page

## Files Modified
- `admin-dashboard.html` - Added admin role verification and better error handling
- `server.js` - Added debugging middleware and admin dashboard route
- `create-admin.js` - Script to create admin user
- `test-admin.html` - Test page for debugging

## API Endpoints

- `PUT /api/appointments/appointments/:id` - Update appointment (admin only)
- `DELETE /api/appointments/appointments/:id` - Delete appointment (admin only)
